Tic Tac Toe is a simple Windows Forms application written in C#.

It was my final project for my first semester of learning to code, completed about 3 years ago.

The game allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe against each other in a graphical interface. It includes features such as:

Player turn tracking
Win checking
Restart button to play again
Display of red screen if player X wins and blue screen if player O wins
This project serves as a good example of my early programming skills and the progress I have made since then.
